Peak power demands have increased beyond what the power grid can deliver ,Make a demand response agreement with residential customers to turn off there water heaters during peak demand times,Build new coal plants to supply more power during peak demand,Install utility scale solar farm to deliver power during peak power time,Good Work! Residence turning off there water heaters during peak times reduced peak power demand +50 points!,50,The government has placed caps on the amount of carbon emission created each year. New coal plants would violate the carbon cap - 50 points ,-50,Solar doesn't emit carbon but it also is not available during peak power times as the sun is going down -20 points,-20
Transmission Line congestion is causing high power prices in California,Build new HV transmission lines from Washington to California,Build utility scale solar in sunny California,Don't supply any power to California,The HV line solved the California energy crisis but it raised the price of power in Washington -20 points,-20,Awesome! California is has a great solar resource and utility scale solar helps offset transmission line congestion +50 points!,50,California experienced rolling blackouts that ended up destabilizing the grid in the surrounding states - 30 points,30
No generation exists on the Oregon coast limiting economic growth,Build more transmission lines across the cascade mountain range,Install new wave energy systems on the Oregon coast to supply coastal towns with wave power,"Develop micorgrids the incorporate batteries, solar power and wave energy conversion",Transmission lines are very expensive and take nearly 10 years to permit and build. Not a good option -70 points,-70,Wave energy conversion is an excellent as costs have decreased while efficiency has increased +50 points!,50,"Good Work! The microgrid complete with batteries, solar and wave energy conversion systems supplies costal town with enough power to boost the local economy! +100 points",100
A large number of old generation units are set to be decommissioned and the lost generation must be replaced,Replace these old decommissioned power plants with new coal power plants,Do not replace the old decommissioned power plants,Build new wind farms to supply the capacity lost to decommissioned plants,No more coal! The public is tired of coal and environmentalist stage protest against new coal plants -30 points,-30,No replacing the decommissioned plants means commercial and industrial power consumers must reduce production and lose profits - 75 points,-75,Wind is an excellent option to supply needed power and reduce carbon emissions epically in Washington where the wind resources is very good +75 points! ,75
The cost of solar panels has decreased and many new residential solar systems have been installed. This cause a  dangerous voltage rise that can push power back onto the grid,Pass laws that limits the amount residential solar that can be installed,Don't worry about the voltage rise and don't limit the residential solar,Spend 30 points to research and design new protection systems to limit the dangerous push back onto the grid ,Passing laws that limit solar anger customer who are trying to limit damage to the environment and protest ensue -50 points,-50,The voltage rise is dangerous and a work fixing a power line received a 1000 volt shock because the solar was pushing power onto the grid - 100 points,-100,Researching new protection schemes is the best option to reduce as much carbon emissions as possible while protecting the existing power grid +50 points! ,20
Peak power demands in the evening require a large amount of power delivered over a short time period. ,Use Utility scale solar power to supply the needed power,Spend 70 points to install utility scale solar power with large battery bank,Use the existing power plants to supply high ramping power,Oh no! The sun is down in the evening when the high ramping rate is needed and solar can't supply the power - 50 points,-50,Awesome! The new solar farm and battery bank is expensive but the batteries can store the energy produced during the day and deliver at peak power times. You profit from selling you power at a high price +100 points!,100,The law state the 25% of all power produce must be renewable energy. You choose not to use renewables and this is in violation of the standard -50 points,-50
Global warming is causing large hydro power reservoirs to shrink lowering the available hydro power production ,Take no action as Hydro power is not critical,Spend 50 points researching and developing new renewable energy sites,Research new shading technology to reduce the evaporation from the dam reservoir ,Oh no! Hydro is a critical power source responsible for much of the PNW power production - 50 points,-50,Good work! Because of your investment a new geothermal power plant site was discovered and developed. Geothermal power plants have are consistent and have high capacity +75 points!,75,No! Shading technology is not a good investment for hydro reservoirs as the water in the reservoir is constantly moving and must flow through the turbine -30 points,-30
A large solar thermal plant is set to be commissioned in the Nevada desert Concerns are raised about endangered birds being burned heat rays.  ,Commission the plant anyway,Spend 30 points researching the endangered species migrating patterns and determine the danger to the birds,Don't commission the solar thermal power plant,Oh no! The solar plant was directly in the migration pattern of a rare endangered species. Massive protest ensue -50 points,-50,Good Idea! The steady concluded that there was no real danger posed by the solar thermal plant as the migratory path of the birds did not go directly through the power plant +75 points!,75,Choosing not to commission the plant was a waste of money and Nevada experienced power shortages because of this decisions -50 points,-50
